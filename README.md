# Loan-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

We loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

k-Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression
